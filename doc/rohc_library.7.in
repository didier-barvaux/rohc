rohc_library \- The ROHC library

.B #include <rohc/rohc.h>
.B #include <rohc/rohc_traces.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBRObust Header Compression (ROHC) library\fP is an implementation of the
\fBROHC protocol\fP. See
.BR rohc_protocol (7)
for details. It provides an easy and robust way for applications to reduce
their bandwidth usage on network links with limited capacity or expensive
costs. Headers of network packets are compressed with the \fBROHC protocol and
algorithms\fP.
.PP
The \fBROHC library\fP is intended for developers who want to reduce the
bandwidth requirements of their applications. The library is published under
the \fBGPL license\fP (version 2 or later).
.PP
The API of the \fBROHC library\fP is divided into three parts: the common API,
the compression API, and the decompression API.
.SS The common API
.PP
The common API of the ROHC library allows a program to print the version of
the ROHC library, or retrieve the description of ROHC modes and packets. No
initialization is required. See
.BR rohc.h (3)
for more details.
.SS The compression API
.PP
The compression API of the ROHC library allows a program to compress the
protocol headers of some uncompressed packets into ROHC packets. See
.BR rohc_comp.h (3)
for more details.
.SS The decompression API
.PP
The decompression API of the ROHC library allows a program to decompress some
ROHC packets into uncompressed packets. See
.BR rohc_decomp.h (3)
for more details.

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
The example code below creates a ROHC compressor, compresses an IP packet,
then frees the ROHC compressor.
.PP
If the code is recorded in a file named example.c, the code can be compiled
with the following command:
.PP
.RS 2
.nf
$ gcc -o example -Wall -g $( pkg-config --cflags --libs rohc ) example.c
.fi
.RE
.PP
Then the code can be executed as follow:
.PP
.RS 2
.nf
$ ./example
create the ROHC compressor
please define a callback for compressor traces
enable several ROHC compression profiles

build a fake IP packet
0x45 0x00 0x00 0x26 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
0x01 0x86 0xbe 0xef 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04
0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x68 0x65 0x6c 0x6c
0x6f 0x2c 0x20 0x52 0x4f 0x48 0x43 0x20
0x77 0x6f 0x72 0x6c 0x64 0x21

compress the fake IP packet
ROHC packet resulting from the ROHC compression:
0xfd 0x04 0x77 0x40 0x86 0x01 0x02 0x03
0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x00 0x01 0x00
0x00 0x20 0x00 0x9d 0x56 0x68 0x65 0x6c
0x6c 0x6f 0x2c 0x20 0x52 0x4f 0x48 0x43
0x20 0x77 0x6f 0x72 0x6c 0x64 0x21

destroy the ROHC decompressor

The program ended successfully. The ROHC packet is larger than the IP packet
(39 bytes versus 38 bytes). This is expected since we only compress one packet
in this simple example. Keep in mind that ROHC is designed to compress streams
of packets not one single packet.
