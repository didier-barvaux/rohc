.SH "NAME"
rohc_comp_get_last_packet_info2 \- Get some information about the last compressed packet.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_comp.h>
.sp
\fBbool rohc_comp_get_last_packet_info2\fP(
    \fBconst struct rohc_comp *const         comp\fP,
    \fBrohc_comp_last_packet_info2_t *const  info\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Get some information about the last compressed packet.
.PP 
To use the function, call it with a pointer on a pre\-allocated rohc_comp_last_packet_info2_t structure with the \fBversion_major\fP and \fBversion_minor\fP fields set to one of the following supported versions:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu Major 0, minor 0
.PP 
.RE
.PP 
See the rohc_comp_last_packet_info2_t structure for details about fields that are supported in the above versions.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B comp
The ROHC compressor to get information from 
.TP
.B info [input, output]
The structure where information will be stored 
.SH STRUCTURES
.SS "Some information about the last compressed packet"
.PP
.sp
.PP 
The structure is used by the \fBrohc_comp_get_last_packet_info2\fP function to store some information about the last compressed packet.
.PP 
Versioning works as follow:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu The \fBversion_major\fP field defines the compatibility level. If the major number given by user does not match the one expected by the library, an error is returned.
.PP 
\(bu The \fBversion_minor\fP field defines the extension level. If the minor number given by user does not match the one expected by the library, only the fields supported in that minor version will be filled by \fBrohc_comp_get_last_packet_info2\fP.
.PP

.PP 
Notes for developers:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu Increase the major version if a field is removed.
.PP 
\(bu Increase the major version if a field is added at the beginning or in the middle of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu Increase the minor version if a field is added at the very end of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu The version_major and version_minor fields must be located at the very beginning of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu The structure must be packed.
