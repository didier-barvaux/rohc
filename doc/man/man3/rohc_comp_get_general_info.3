.SH "NAME"
rohc_comp_get_general_info \- Get some general information about the compressor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_comp.h>
.sp
\fBbool rohc_comp_get_general_info\fP(
    \fBconst struct rohc_comp *const    comp\fP,
    \fBrohc_comp_general_info_t *const  info\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Get some general information about the compressor.
.PP 
To use the function, call it with a pointer on a pre\-allocated rohc_comp_general_info_t structure with the \fBversion_major\fP and \fBversion_minor\fP fields set to one of the following supported versions:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu Major 0, minor 0
.PP 
.RE
.PP 
See the rohc_comp_general_info_t structure for details about fields that are supported in the above versions.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B comp
The ROHC compressor to get information from 
.TP
.B info [input, output]
The structure where information will be stored 
.SH STRUCTURES
.SS "Some general information about the compressor"
.PP
.sp
.PP 
The structure is used by the \fBrohc_comp_get_general_info\fP function to store some general information about the compressor.
.PP 
Versioning works as follow:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu The \fBversion_major\fP field defines the compatibility level. If the major number given by user does not match the one expected by the library, an error is returned.
.PP 
\(bu The \fBversion_minor\fP field defines the extension level. If the minor number given by user does not match the one expected by the library, only the fields supported in that minor version will be filled by \fBrohc_comp_get_general_info\fP.
.PP

.PP 
Notes for developers:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu Increase the major version if a field is removed.
.PP 
\(bu Increase the major version if a field is added at the beginning or in the middle of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu Increase the minor version if a field is added at the very end of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu The version_major and version_minor fields must be located at the very beginning of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu The structure must be packed.

Supported versions:
