.SH "NAME"
rohc_decomp_get_prtt \- Get the number of packets sent during one Round-Trip Time (RTT).

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Get the maximum number of packets sent in worst case by the remote ROHC compressor for one given stream (ie. one compression/decompression context) during one Round\-Trip Time (RTT).
.PP 
The number of packets sent by the remote ROHC compressor is used to estimate how many SN bits those feedbacks shall transmit to avoid any ambiguity at compressor about the ROHC packet that is (n)acknowledged by the decompressor.
.PP 
The pRTT value must be in range [0 ; SIZE_MAX/2[. If set to 0, all SN bits are always transmitted.
.PP 
The default value is 50 packets / RTT, ie. a RTT of 1 second with one packet transmitted every 20 milliseconds (classic VoIP stream). If your network streams and conditions differ, change the default value.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B decomp
The ROHC decompressor 
.TP
.B prtt [output]
The number of packets sent during one RTT
