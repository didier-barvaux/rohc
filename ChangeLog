09 Jun 2013 - release 1.6.0
  Compatibility:
    - Version 1.6.0 is not compatible with versions < 1.6.0 because of several
      fixes related to IETF RFCs that change the format of ROHC packets.
    - The library API is mainly compatible with earlier versions: some private
      entities that were made public by mistake are not public anymore. It
      might break some programs that were using them by mistake.

  License/Authors:
    - Mikhail Gruzdev, Thales Communications, and Viveris Technologies for
      Linux kernel support.
    - Audric Schiltknecht and Julien Bernard from Viveris Technologies for
      constant IP-ID support, the new RTP profile detection mechanism, and
      the new trace framework.
    - Yura for the ROHC fuzzer.
    - Raman Gupta for ROHC-over-Ethernet tunnel support.

  Main changes:
    - ROHC protocol:

       - Support for ROHC segment as specified by §5.2.5 of RFC 3095.
       - Improve handling of TS, TS_STRIDE, TS_OFFSET and TS_SCALED values.
       - Protect STATIC-NACK feedback with CRC. CRC is required if changing
         operation mode.
       - Several compression/decompression bugs (see below).
    - Library API/usage:
       - Improve RTP profile detection with a new user callback or with new
         API functions to add/remove/reset UDP ports dedicated to RTP traffic.
       - Add new trace framework with user-defined callbacks.
    - Portability:
       - Support for Linux kernel.
       - Support for OpenBSD (tested on 5.3 thanks to Audric Schiltknecht).
       - Support for mingw64.
       - Support for CYGWIN.
       - Support for GCC 4.8, Clang 3.2, and TCC.
       - RPM spec file for CentOS 5/6, Fedora 17/18 and RHEL 5.

  API changes:
    - Add rohc_compress2(), rohc_comp_get_segment() and return code
      ROHC_NEED_SEGMENT to handle ROHC segments.
    - Update rohc_decompress() to return ROHC_NON_FINAL_SEGMENT to handle ROHC
      segments.
    - rohc_compress() is deprecated by rohc_compress2().
    - Add rohc_comp_set_rtp_detection_cb() to define the user-defined RTP
      detection callback.
    - Add rohc_comp_add_rtp_port(), rohc_comp_remove_rtp_port(), and
      rohc_comp_reset_rtp_ports() to manage the UDP ports dedicated to RTP
      streams.
    - Add rohc_comp_set_traces_cb() and rohc_decomp_set_traces_cb() to manage
      library traces with user-defined callbacks.
    - Add rohc_feedback_remove_locked() (remove feedbacks once transmitted),
      rohc_feedback_unlock() (restore feedbacks if transmission failed).
    - Add rohc_comp_get_last_packet_info2() to get compression statistics.
    - rohc_comp_get_last_packet_info() is deprecated by
      rohc_comp_get_last_packet_info2().
    - Add rohc_decomp_get_last_packet_info() to get decompression statistics.
    - Add functions rohc_comp_get_general_info(), rohc_comp_get_mrru(),
      rohc_comp_get_max_cid() and rohc_comp_get_cid_type() to replace
      functions rohc_c_info(), rohc_c_statistics() and rohc_c_context() that
      are now deprecated.
    - Add rohc_comp_force_contexts_reinit() to re-initialize compression
      contexts.
    - Remove nonnull as function attribute for public API.
    - public header cleanup: move some private definitions from rohc.h to
      private headers.
    - public header cleanup: move all private decompressor definitions from
      rohc_decomp.h to rohc_decomp_internals.h

  Build system:
    - Append bzr revision number to library version if built from bzr.
    - Split --enable-rohc-apps into several different options (see below).
    - Add --disable-deprecated-api to disable deprecated code (testing only).
    - Change the behavior of the --enable-rohc-debug configure option:
      Old behavior: --enable-rohc-debug={1,2,3} configured as build time the
                    level of debug of the library.
      New behavior: --enable-rohc-debug={yes,no} configures only extra debug
                    for the library.
      Debug traces are managed by the new trace framework. Extra debug traces
      that may reduce the library performances are only enabled if
      --enable-rohc-debug or --enable-rohc-debug=yes are specified. The extra
      debug traces are off by default.
    - Use CPPFLAGS for -I options instead of CFLAGS.
    - Do not override CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and LDFLAGS in configure.
    - Support out-of-sources builds.
    - Support Clang 3.2.
    - Support GCC 4.8.

  Q&A:
    - Add const keywords in several function prototypes.
    - Fix warnings emitted by the static code analyzer of the Clang compiler.
    - Improve the robustness of the compressor API.
    - Improve test coverage.
    - Improve API documentation.
    - Move all private definitions out from public headers.
    - Define many private functions as static in UDP and UDP-Lite profiles.

  Performances:
    - Simplify the rohc_f_32bits() function.
    - Introduce a context key to quickly match packets and contexts.
    - Stop search for the compression context if all used contexts were
      already checked.
    - Create all compression contexts at init instead of at runtime.
    - Dump compressed and uncompressed packets only in extra debug mode.
    - Avoid using zfree() when free() is enough.

  Applications:
    General:
      - Split --enable-rohc-apps into several different options:
        --enable-app-fuzzer   --enable-app-performance
        --enable-app-sniffer  --enable-app-tunnel
    ROHC-over-UDP tunnel:
      - Handle decompression.
      - Handle small/large CIDs and MAX_CID.
      - Add ROHC-over-Ethernet support (Raman Gupta).
      - Avoid using internal information from the library.
      - Fix the usage description.
    ROHC sniffer:
      - New tool that permits to easily test the library on a real network
        without affecting it. The program sniffs IP packets from a given
        network interface, and tests the ROHC library with them. The packets
        are compressed, then decompressed, and finally compared with the
        original IP packets.
    ROHC fuzzer:
      - New tool that checks the robustness of the ROHC decompressor with
        random ROHC packets. Contributed by Yura.
    Performances test:
      - Increase test duration for CPU frequency.

    Rename rohc.c into rohc_common.c to avoid problems when building code for
      Linux kernel.
    Add option --enable-fortify_sources to add -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 to CFLAGS.

    Avoid several calls to strlen() in functions that return statistics.
    Remove useless ceil() calls.
    Improve W-LSB speed.
    Allocate the array of decompression contexts to its full size to avoid
      re-allocations during packet processing.
