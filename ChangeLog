      entities that were made public by mistake are not public anymore. It
      might break some programs that were using them by mistake.

  License/Authors:
    - Mikhail Gruzdev, Thales Communications, and Viveris Technologies for
      Linux kernel support.
    - Audric Schiltknecht and Julien Bernard from Viveris Technologies for

      rohc_comp_get_max_cid() and rohc_comp_get_cid_type() to replace
      functions rohc_c_info(), rohc_c_statistics() and rohc_c_context() that
      are now deprecated.
    - Add rohc_comp_force_contexts_reinit() to re-initialize compression
      contexts.
    - Remove nonnull as function attribute for public API.
    - public header cleanup: move some private definitions from rohc.h to
      private headers.
    - public header cleanup: move all private decompressor definitions from
      rohc_decomp.h to rohc_decomp_internals.h

  Build system:
    - Append bzr revision number to library version if built from bzr.
    - Split --enable-rohc-apps into several different options (see below).
    - Add --disable-deprecated-api to disable deprecated code (testing only).
    - Change the behavior of the --enable-rohc-debug configure option:
      Old behavior: --enable-rohc-debug={1,2,3} configured as build time the
                    level of debug of the library.
      New behavior: --enable-rohc-debug={yes,no} configures only extra debug
                    for the library.
      Debug traces are managed by the new trace framework. Extra debug traces
      that may reduce the library performances are only enabled if
      --enable-rohc-debug or --enable-rohc-debug=yes are specified. The extra
      debug traces are off by default.

    - Improve test coverage.
    - Improve API documentation.
    - Move all private definitions out from public headers.
    - Define many private functions as static in UDP and UDP-Lite profiles.

  Performances:
    - Simplify the rohc_f_32bits() function.
    - Introduce a context key to quickly match packets and contexts.
    - Stop search for the compression context if all used contexts were
      already checked.
    - Create all compression contexts at init instead of at runtime.
    - Dump compressed and uncompressed packets only in extra debug mode.
    - Avoid using zfree() when free() is enough.

  Applications:
    General:
      - Split --enable-rohc-apps into several different options:
        --enable-app-fuzzer   --enable-app-performance
        --enable-app-sniffer  --enable-app-tunnel
    ROHC-over-UDP tunnel:
      - Handle decompression.

      - Add ROHC-over-Ethernet support (Raman Gupta).
      - Avoid using internal information from the library.
      - Fix the usage description.
    ROHC sniffer:
      - New tool that permits to easily test the library on a real network
        without affecting it. The program sniffs IP packets from a given
        network interface, and tests the ROHC library with them. The packets
        are compressed, then decompressed, and finally compared with the
        original IP packets.
    ROHC fuzzer:
      - New tool that checks the robustness of the ROHC decompressor with
        random ROHC packets. Contributed by Yura.

  Enhance the ROHC API to better handle feedback piggybacking
  
  Here is a short explanation of feedback management in the ROHC framework
  (see RFC 3095 for more details). Let's try to transmit compressed information
  from node n1 to node n2.
  
  Each node got a compressor and a decompressor. Compressor A compresses data,
  sends it to decompressor A (1) that then decompresses it. Compressor A and
  decompressor A make a pair. If decompressor A wants to send some feedback
  information to compressor A, it asks the same-side associated compressor B

  decompressor B (3). When decompressor B receives the feedback, it gives that
  information to the same-side associated compressor A (4).

   +---------------------+                 +---------------------+
  
  The change in source code is related to steps (2) and (3). When decompressor A
  decompresses the ROHC packet emitted by compressor A, decompressor A might want
  to transmit some feedback information to compressor A. The decompressor A used
  to automatically gives the feedback information to compressor B in a transparent
  way (ie. no user interaction). Indeed, the decompressor A used to call the function
  rohc_comp_piggyback_feedback(compressor A, feedback_data, feedback_size) directly.
  
  This used to have a major drawback: the decompression (decompressor A) and
  compression (compressor B) actions on one single node (node B) couldn't be run
  in separate threads. The decompression action could modify the compression context
  with no synchronisation mechanism at all, so thread cannot be used efficiently.
  
  Now, at step (2), the feedback information generated by decompressor A for its
  remote peer compressor A can now be retrieved thanks to an additional parameter
  added to the rohc_decompress3() function:
  
  	int rohc_decompress3(struct rohc_decomp *const decomp,
  	                     const struct rohc_buf rohc_packet,
  	                     struct rohc_buf *const uncomp_packet,
  	                     struct rohc_buf *const rcvd_feedback,
  	                     struct rohc_buf *const feedback_send);
  
  By removing the direct call, the user gets in charge of retrieving the feedback
  to be sent during decompression and sending it on the remote peer for the
  compressor A. The user may perform this action in two different ways: he/she
  sends the data on his/her own (it entirely depends on the user application) or
  he/she uses piggybacking by prepending the content of `feedback_send` before any
  ROHC packet generated by the compressor B. The decompressor B will retrieve the
  feedback data and gives it to the user through the `rcvd_feedback` parameter of
  the rohc_decompress3() function. The user gains control on the feedback
  transmission and can use locks if needed.
  
  Note that the old API still works the way it always worked. The rohc_decompress(),
  rohc_decompress2() and rohc_decompress_both() functions automatically sends
  feedback information to the same-side associated compressor. And, the rohc_compress(),
  rohc_compress2() and rohc_compress3() functions still piggyback that feedback
  information automatically.

  The change in source code is related to steps (3) and (4). When decompressor B
  decompresses the feedback information emitted by compressor B on behalf of
  decompressor A, decompressor B used to automatically gives the feedback information
  to compressor A in a transparent way (ie. no user interaction). Decompressor B
  used to call rohc_comp_deliver_feedback(compressor A, feedback) directly.
  
  This used to have a major drawback: the compression (compressor A) and
  decompression (decompressor B) actions on one single node couldn't be run in
  separate threads. The decompression action could modify the compression context
  with no synchronisation mechanism at all, so thread cannot be used efficiently.
  
  Now, at step (4), the feedback information transmitted by decompressor A to its
  remote peer compressor A can now be retrieved thanks to an additional parameter
  added to the rohc_decompress3() function:
  
  	int rohc_decompress3(struct rohc_decomp *const decomp,
  	                     const struct rohc_buf rohc_packet,
  	                     struct rohc_buf *const uncomp_packet,
  	                     struct rohc_buf *const rcvd_feedback);
  
  By removing the direct call, the user gets in charge of retrieving the received
  feedback during decompression and delivering it to the related compressor. The
  user gains control on the feedback transmission and can use locks if needed.
  
  To achieve this, feedback-related code was reworked:
   * rohc_comp_deliver_feedback2() is introduced to accept a struct rohc_buf as
     parameter and accept several feedback items at once.
   * code for parsing feedback is now shared between compression and decompression
     libraries (it is located in common, files feedback_parse.c/h).
   * code for creating feedback was moved from src/decomp/feedback.c/h to
     src/decomp/feedback_create.c/h
   * ROHC_FEEDBACK_ONLY return code is not returned any more by rohc_decompress3()
  	because checking whether rcvd_feedback is empty gives the same information.
   * ROHC_NON_FINAL_SEGMENT return code is not returned any more by rohc_decompress3()
  	because we can now check if uncomp_packet is empty or not, this gives the same
  	information.

  This change almost completely reverts change at revision 1086 entitled:
    TCP profile: do not transmit ACK number if ACK flag = 0 and ACK number = 0
  
  The revert is required because this optimisation cannot handle correctly the
  case where N subsequent TCP packets are sent with ACK flag = 0 and the very
  same non-zero ACK number. If N is large enough, the variable_length_32_enc()
  encoding method will need 0 bit to be transmitted (static behavior), but the
  decompressor will mistaken it as ACK number = 0. Optimisation is not possible
  in all cases, so remove it.

  Add a network buffer implementation
  
  A network buffer may represent one uncompressed packet, one ROHC packet, or one
  ROHC feedback.
  
  The network buffer does not contain the packet data itself. It only has a
  pointer on it. This is designed this way for performance reasons: no copy
  required to initialize a network buffer, the struct is small and may be passed
  as copy to function.
  
  The network buffer is able to keep some free space at its beginning. The
  unused space at the beginning of the buffer may be used to prepend a network
  header at the very end of the packet handling.
  
  The beginning of the network buffer may also be shifted forward and backward
  with the rohc_buf_shift function. This is useful when parsing a network packet
  (once bytes are read, shift them forward) for example.
  
  The network buffer may be initialized manually by filling all the fields of the
  struct or with the helper functions rohc_buf_init_empty or rohc_buf_init_full.

  use the Uncompressed profile if IPv4 checksum is incorrect
  
  If the IPv4 checksum is incorrect (both for outer or inner IP header), the ROHC
  compression/decompression won't be able to transmit the packet unchanged byte
  per byte. The IPv4 checksum will be computed correctly at decompressor and it
  won't match the original one.
  
  To avoid this, verify the IPv4 checksums at compressor and avoid to use the
  IP-based profiles if at least one of them is incorrect. Use the Uncompressed
  profile instead.
  
  This behaviour is the safest way to go. However, verifying the checksums might
  be time consuming and might degrade the CPU performances, so add a compressor
  feature to disable that verification. The feature is named:
  	ROHC_COMP_FEATURE_NO_IP_CHECKSUMS

  TCP profile: better handle TCP options.
  
  Fixes several problems related to TCP options:
   * The TCP profile handles unknown TCP option in a different manner than other
     options. The code that handles those unknown options was wrong. It didn't
     choose correctly a free index for the option.
   * The TCP profile didn't dynamically detect whether it should use 4-bit or
     8-bit XI indexes when compressing TCP options, so compressing a TCP packet
     with 8 or more different TCP options failed. Now, the indexes are chosen
     during the first packet analysis and the largest index causes the 4-bit or
     8-bit indexes to be chosen.
   * One TCP packet may handle up to 40 bytes of TCP options. In worst case, it
     may thus handle 40 1-byte TCP options. However, the ROHC TCP format doesn't
     allow for more than 15 options. So, packets with 16 or more options shall
     fallback to the IP-only profile.

  non-regression: add scripts to download and test external/personal captures.
  
  Sometimes we have a network capture that causes a trouble to the ROHC library.
  We fix the problem and we would like the problem not to come back later. The
  best way to achieve this is to put the network capture in the non-regression
  tests.
  
  However, it might happen that the capture contains sensitive and personal data,
  so uploading it in a public location is not an option. There is now an
  alternative:
   1/ put the capture in:
       test/non_regression/other_inputs/personal_inputs/
   2/ then run:
       $ make -C test/non_regression/other_inputs/ check_personal
  
  However, it might happen that the capture is under copyright and cannot be
  published with ROHC. The capture might also be huge (> 1 GB). There is now an
  alternative:
   1/ download the captures:
       $ make -C test/non_regression/other_inputs/ download

  Tests with the TM500(LTE) equipment by Aeroflex reported a problem with
  TCP IR packets. The IR packet is decompressed unsuccessfully with the
  ROHC library.
  
  After analysis the problem was caused by the compression of TCP options.
  The ROHC library sends the full TCP options as items (type, length, data)
  while it should be sent compressed (see *_list_item starting at page 65
  of RFC 6846):
  	nop_list_item
  	mss_list_item
  	wscale_list_item
  	tsopt_list_item
  	sack_list_item
  	sack_permitted_list_item
  	generic_list_item
  
  Add the TCP stream compressed by the Aeroflex TM500(LTE) equipment as
  interoperability and non-regression tests.

  Create a ROHC stats application from the ./statistics/* tests.
  
  The tests located in the ./statistics/ subdir were n,ot very useful. The
  compression statistics generated from the testing captures were not
  representative of any real-world traffic.
  
  In addition, it was difficult to generate the statistics for a network
  capture that was not a test capture:
   - the ./statistics/generate_statistics binary was not enough to generate
      interesting graphs,
   - the ./statistics/generate_statistics.sh script was able to generate
     interesting graphs but it was designed to get network captures from a
     fixed location (non-regression tests).
  
  The new ROHC stats application is not run as a autotools test anymore. It
  may be run against any network capture easily. It doesn't generate graphs
  but the ./app/stats/rohc_stats.sh shell script is able to do so for one
  single capture.

  W-LSB: compute the minimum number of required bits for all values in window
  
  The ROHC decompressor shall be able to decode the W-LSB-compressed value with
  any reference value in the compressor window. The compressor computed the
  minimum number of required bits based on the minimum and maximum values of the
  window, but it is wrong: the compressor shall compute the minimum number of
  required bits based on all the values in the window.
  
  Example with window values: { 4294961711, 4294961715, 2623, 2632 }
  The minimum number of required bits was computed based on the minimum
  value (2623) and the maximum value (4294961715). This is wrong because a
  wraparound happened: minimum is 4294961715 and maximum is 2632.
  
  Because it is difficult to reliabily detect a wraparound (think about
  reordering), better compute the minimum number of required bits based on all
  values in the window, and keep only the greatest.

  Deprecate the ROHC over UDP tunnel.
  
  From https://answers.launchpad.net/rohc/+question/245813:
    I have just decided to deprecate the ROHC over UDP tunnel. I don't use it for
    testing for a long time. I now use the sniffer and fuzzer tools for that. They
    are much better. For the tunnel features, the IP/ROHC tunnel now supersedes
    the ROHC over UDP tunnel: the IP/ROHC tunnel is designed for efficiency and
    may be used in production.
    So, next 1.7.0 version of the ROHC library will still contain the ROHC over
    UDP tunnel but a deprecation warning will be present in the wiki, in the
    sources, in the configure script, in the program usage, and in program man
    page. The version after will completely remove the ROHC over UDP tunnel from
    the sources.

  Fix bug #1265304: RTP decompression failure with repeated constant TS
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/rohc/+bug/1265304
  
  If RTP TS is constant, it must be transmitted uncompressed. It is however sent
  encoded with W-LSB. So, given enough RTP packets with the same constant RTP TS
  value, 0 bit are needed by the decompressor to decode the value. As it is
  forbidden to not sent at least 1 bit of TS when it is constant, the compressor
  forces the transmission of 1 bit.
  In the meanwhile, the TS bits to send were reset, so the compressor sends
  bits(TS) = 0. That's wrong. The TS bit shall be extracted again from the
  uncompressed TS in such a case.
  
  In addition to the bug fox, improve a little bit the robustness by sending
  7 bits of TS instead of 1. The field is sent encoded in SDVL, so 1 or 7 bits
  take 1 byte. Better send 7 bits!

  Previous revision sent 0x00 as compressed list when no IPv6 extension headers
  were present since the beginning of the stream. However, noone can be sure
  of the beginning of one stream if context re-use was in action.
  
  The problem was discovered by adding new non-regression tests that compress
  then decompress all existing network captures with only one single context.
  
  The rtp_uo_disambiguation test was updated to reduce the number of uncompressed
  transmissions required for list compression. This was performed to avoid
  changing all input captures to generate the expected packets.

  make the number of uncompressed transmissions for list compression configurable
  
  Introduce the new rohc_comp_set_list_trans_nr() function in the compression API
  so that users may configure the number of uncompressed transmissions for list
  compression, ie. the L parameter described in RFC 3095 and 4815.

  Rework list compression, especially list compression of IPv6 extension headers.
  
  In short:
  * more conform to RFC 3095 that previous code
  * simpler, more factorized code
  * save some bits in ROHC headers
  
  In long:
  * replace single-linked list by fixed-size lists
  * allocate all contexts/lists/items at the beginning
  * split generic list compression from IPv6 specific compression
  * avoid reading the lists many times
  * better handle context re-use
  * more conform to RFC 3095 that previous code
  * split list code in separate files
  * simpler, more factorized code
  * save some bits in ROHC headers

  The ROHC RTP fuzzer is a fuzzing tool that compresses, then decompresses some
  RTP traffic. The RTP traffic is generated with some fields changing randomly.
  
  The ROHC RTP fuzzer application may be used the same way as the existing ROHC

  API: build an additional librohc.so to aggregate librohc_*.so
  
  From ever the ROHC library was split into 3 .so files: librohc_common.so,
  librohc_comp.so, and librohc_decomp.so. This was done so that a program
  could load compression code without loading decompression code. In fact,
  such programs should be quite rare, and the 3 .so files are quite small
  (~650KB all once striped). So, give up and provide a librohc.so.
  
  The new librohc.so currently contains no code, it only depends on the 3
  others .so files. The other .so files will be made convenient libraries
  in the 2.0.0 releases, and not installed anymore.
  
  Update the pkg-config file rohc.pc right now. That way, developers using
  pkg-config will automatically use the new library instead of the old ones.

  Those headers issue a warning during compilation so that developers know that

  A malformed ROHC packet can cause the decompressor to build more IP headers
  than expected, waiting for TCP protocol magic number. Correction: always
  check that is room remaining for the next IP header context before using it.

  RTP profile: avoid the Tsc = 0 and no TS bit situation
  
  According to the RFC, a packet with Tsc = 0 and no TS bit is invalid and
  shall be discarded. To avoid generating such packets, force sending some
  TS bits in extension 3 if TS is not scaled (Tsc = 0) and the base header
  contains zero TS bit.

  Fix an endianness problem on PowerPC with fix for bug #1210498.
  
  Bug #1210498 is entitled "IP-ID shall be transmitted verbatim in IR and IR-DYN
  packets".
  
  On PowerPC, the IP-ID bits of the IR and IR-DYN packets shall be swapped when
  decoded if the IP-ID behavior is 'increase in Little Endian'. Otherwise, they
  will be swapped when written in the decompressed IP packet.
