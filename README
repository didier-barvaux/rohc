Introduction
------------

This piece of software is an implementation of RObust Header Compression for
Linux (or other Unix-compatible OS). The library can be used to add ROHC
compression/decompression capabilities to an application.

License
-------

The project is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2.1 or later, see the COPYING
and AUTHORS files for more details.

Some network captures or small scripts used for testing are under the GNU GPL
version 2 or later.


Libraries
---------

The sources are in the src subdirectory. The sources are separated into three
libraries:
 - a library that contains the routines used for both the compression and the
   decompression processes
 - a library that handles the compression process
 - a library that handles the decompression process

See the INSTALL file to learn to build the libraries.


Automated tests
---------------

The test subdirectory contains several test applications. See the INSTALL file
to learn how to use these tools.


Statistics
----------

The statistics subdirectory contains an application that generates some
compression statistics. The generate_statistics.sh script outputs a HTML report
with the statistics results. The Gnuplot tool is required.

See the INSTALL file to learn how to use the statistics application and the
generate_statistics.sh script.


Python binding
--------------

As of version 2.0.0, a Python binding was added. It is not as CPU performant as
the C library, so it is only recommended for testing or rapid prototyping. See
the INSTALL file to learn building and installing the Python binding.

The Python binding currently only supports Python 2.x. The Python module does
not work correctly with Python 3.x for the moment.
